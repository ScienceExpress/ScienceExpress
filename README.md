## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
A portable, automated pre-enrichment system for the rapid detection of bacteria in water samples. My work combines CFD-modeling, Arduino-based automation, surface functionalizations and magnetic separation.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
Python programming for data analysis and deep learning, time-series analysis with LSTMs, and optimization techniques for engineering systems.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: 
MedTech, CFD modeling, CAD design, or tips on pursuing interdisciplinary research!
